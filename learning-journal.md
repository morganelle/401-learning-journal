# Learning Journal for 401 Python

Happily back to the grind after 1 month off, 1 month as a TA, and another 2 weeks off. I really enjoyed the opportunity to be a TA, but by the end of it I was envious of the students - I wanted back into the classroom!

Today we got a quick intro to environments, and - if I understand correctly - an environment walls off what packages and variables your code has access to. With that in mind, it sounds like our assignments are supposed to be contained in environments, which should give us finer control. We also talked about more Python-specific features, like using dir to see a list of an object's attributes.

Every time another student asked a question in lecture, I'm finding that it was a question wouldn't have thought to ask and was glad to learn the answer.

Last night, I read "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist" and found the concept of formal languages (as opposed to natural languages) really interesting. From the book: "Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols... Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations." Formal languages are supposed to be unambiguous and concise.
